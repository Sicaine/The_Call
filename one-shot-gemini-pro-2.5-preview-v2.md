# The Fifteen-Year Echo

Elias Vance lived for the Great Silence. From his cramped shack in the New Mexico desert, surrounded by the humming consoles and the skeletal frame of his custom-built radio telescope, he listened to the static symphony of the cosmos. For years, it had been a predictable tune: the hiss of the cosmic microwave background, the rhythmic pulse of distant neutron stars.

Then came the Anomaly.

It wasn't a pulse or a hiss. It was a thread of pure, unwavering signal, a perfect sine wave tucked into a frequency that should have been empty. Elias spent three hours chasing it, tweaking amplifiers, recalibrating receivers, his heart thumping a frantic rhythm against his ribs. He felt like a safecracker listening for the final tumbler to fall. And then, it did.

A voice, clear and unadorned, echoed in his headphones. It was genderless, calm, and spoke perfect, if slightly formal, English.

*“Planet Earth, please listen. If you can hear me, please listen. I will continue my transmission in approximately three hours.”*

The message repeated. Elias fumbled for his recorder, his hands shaking. He posted the coordinates and the recording to "Arecibo's Ghost," a niche forum for amateur sky-watchers. The first replies were dismissive—a prank, a military satellite, a reflection. But three hours later, telescopes from Chile to Germany were pointed at the same patch of empty sky, and the voice returned.

The world changed overnight.

For the next two weeks, the "Caller," as the media dubbed it, spoke. It wasn't a dialogue; it was a series of monologues, broadcast for an hour each day. The Caller described its world—a place of twin suns and crimson flora. It spoke of cosmic truths that sent physicists scrambling: that the universe wasn't expanding but *breathing*, and that dark matter was the fossilized remains of previous cosmic cycles.

It also spoke of Earth. It praised the intricate genius of Mozart's Requiem and the raw, joyful energy of a band called The Beatles. It marveled at the ambition of the Eiffel Tower and the poignant bravery of the space shuttle *Discovery*'s final mission. It seemed to love humanity, to see it as a beautiful, chaotic, brilliant child of the cosmos.

Elias became an unwilling celebrity, but he ignored the noise. He just listened. He was the first to notice the change in the second week. A subtle strain in the Caller's voice. A new sound in the background, a faint, rhythmic clicking, almost like language, but sharp and guttural.

On the fourteenth day, the Caller’s broadcast began differently. The usual calm was gone, replaced by a terrible, resigned sadness.

*“I have... enjoyed sharing with you,”* it began, its voice wavering. *“Your art. Your capacity for wonder. It is a light. A rare and precious light.”*

The clicking in the background grew louder, more insistent.

*“My people are old,”* the Caller continued, the words coming faster. *“We have seen other lights ignite. We have seen them grow into fires that consumed galaxies. A protocol was established. A promise to our children that they would never face such a fire. We see your trajectory. Your astonishing rate of progress. Your conflicts. The math is... certain.”*

Elias felt a cold dread crystallize in his stomach. He looked at the data scrolling across his screen. The signal's origin point was a star system just over fifteen light-years away. A stone's throw, cosmically speaking.

*“I am a researcher. My role was to understand what we would be losing. To archive the light before it was extinguished. But I did more. I broke protocol. I used this high-gain transmitter to speak to you. To... to bear witness.”*

The clicking was frantic now. A sharp, commanding bark echoed faintly.

*“It’s too late,”* the Caller whispered. The apology was a universe of grief in three syllables. *“The decision was made when we first saw your light, all those years ago. The... instrument... travels at a significant fraction of light speed.”*

A final, heavy sigh from the stars.

*“We fired. You will not see it coming. I’m sorry.”*

And then, silence. A silence more profound and terrible than any Elias had ever known.

The final broadcast threw the world into chaos. But in the hallowed halls of SETI and NASA, a frantic, horrifying calculus was taking place. An analyst in Pasadena was the first to connect the dots.

“The shuttle *Discovery*,” she said, her voice hollow. “Its final flight was in 2011.”

The room went still. Fifteen years ago.

The Caller’s knowledge was fifteen years out of date. It had taken the signal fifteen years to reach Earth.

The message *"We fired"* was also fifteen years old.

The relativistic missile, launched at nearly the speed of light, would have traveled the same distance in almost the same amount of time. The warning hadn't outrun the bullet. It had arrived at the exact same moment.

In the New Mexico desert, Elias Vance stood up and walked out of his shack. He looked up at the daytime sky, no longer listening for a voice from the heavens, but watching for the flash of an impact he would never see.
