# The Call

## Day 1

Sarah Martinez had been listening to the cosmos for three years from her makeshift observatory in the New Mexico desert. The old radio telescope dish, salvaged from a defunct research facility, hummed quietly in the pre-dawn darkness as she swept through frequencies that most people would dismiss as cosmic background noise.

At 3:47 AM, something changed.

The static shifted—not random, but structured. Pattern within chaos. Sarah's coffee grew cold as she fine-tuned the receiver, her heart racing with the possibility that had driven every radio astronomer since the field began: *What if?*

The signal strengthened. Clearer. And then, impossibly, words emerged from the static.

"Planet Earth, please listen. If you can hear me, please listen. I will continue my transmission in approximately three hours."

The message repeated. Again. Again.

Sarah's hands shook as she hit record.

## Day 2

The forums exploded overnight. Sarah's recording, uploaded to amateur radio astronomy boards, spread like wildfire. Within hours, dozens of operators worldwide were tuning to the frequency. The signal was real, consistent, and impossible to fake across multiple continents.

When the voice returned, it was different. More conversational.

"I hope you received my previous message. My name is... the closest translation would be Keth-ra. I am transmitting from a military research complex approximately 8 light-years from your solar system."

The voice paused, as if waiting for a response that could never come.

"I have been studying your world for some time. Your species fascinates me. You create such beautiful music—I particularly enjoy what you call 'jazz.' Miles Davis, John Coltrane... extraordinary expressions of mathematical harmony made emotional."

Around the world, amateur radio operators frantically took notes, their excitement building with each impossible detail.

## Day 5

"Today I want to tell you about the universe as we see it," Keth-ra's voice crackled through the static. "You are not alone. There are forty-seven intelligent species within a hundred light-years of Earth. Most are peaceful. Some... are not."

Sarah had barely slept since the transmissions began. Her small observatory had become an impromptu command center, with other enthusiasts driving from across the Southwest to witness history.

"Your solar system sits in what we call a 'development zone'—a region where younger civilizations are allowed to grow without interference. Think of it as a nature preserve for emerging consciousness."

The implications sent chills through every listener.

"But there are protocols. Rules. When a species reaches certain technological thresholds, decisions must be made."

## Day 8

The transmissions had become daily events, drawing audiences in the millions as major news networks picked up the story. Governments remained officially skeptical, but Sarah noticed unusual activity around radio telescopes worldwide.

"I want to share something personal," Keth-ra said. "Your television programs intrigue me. The way you dramatize conflict and resolution, the complex relationships between characters... I have observed many episodes of what you call 'The Office'—the way your species finds humor in mundane workplace interactions suggests a sophisticated social intelligence."

The alien's voice carried what sounded almost like appreciation.

Sarah frowned. *The Office*? That was from the mid-2000s to early 2010s. Why would an advanced alien civilization studying Earth be referencing such dated cultural artifacts?

## Day 11

"I must tell you about the Void Swarm," Keth-ra continued during what had become the most-watched daily event in human history. "Forty thousand years ago, they consumed the Altair system. Twelve billion conscious beings, gone in a stellar year. The survivors' last transmission was a warning: 'They learn from what they consume. Every world makes them smarter, hungrier.'"

The tone had grown darker over recent days.

"This is why the Interstellar Preservation Council exists. We monitor emerging civilizations for signs of expansion beyond their home systems. When species begin to spread, they can become vectors for the Swarm's attention."

Sarah's blood ran cold. She'd been tracking the references, the cultural touchstones Keth-ra mentioned. All of them—every movie, every song, every piece of human culture—dated from before 2010.

## Day 13

"Your species is remarkable," Keth-ra transmitted. "You have created concepts we struggle to understand—'hope' in the face of certain death, 'love' that transcends genetic advantage, 'art' that serves no survival function yet drives your greatest achievements."

Sarah stared at her notes, the pattern now undeniable. She'd been calculating light-speed delays, comparing cultural references. The evidence was building toward a conclusion that made her stomach twist.

"I have studied your history extensively. The way you rebuilt after your 'World War II,' the progress you made in medicine and space exploration, the gradual recognition of universal rights... it gives me what you would call 'hope.'"

But Sarah wasn't feeling hopeful anymore. She was feeling terrified.

## Day 14

"I need to tell you something important," Keth-ra's voice carried a weight that hadn't been there before. "Our studies of your world began fifteen years ago, when we first detected your radio signatures spreading beyond your solar system."

Sarah's hands clenched. Eight years ago. 2017. Every reference finally made sense.

"We analyzed your trajectory—technological development, resource consumption, population growth, weapons advancement. We ran projections forward, modeling your likely expansion into space."

The static seemed heavier now, filled with something that might have been regret.

"According to our models, your species will achieve interstellar travel within fifty years. And when you do..." The voice paused. "Forgive me. I should explain why this matters."

Sarah's radio crackled with interference—voices in the background, speaking in a language that sounded like crystalline chimes mixed with grinding metal.

"The Council has protocols. Species that expand aggressively, that show certain psychological profiles for conquest and resource extraction, that demonstrate what we call 'viral expansion patterns'... they become eligible for preemptive intervention."

More voices in the background now, urgent and angry.

"I was not supposed to make contact. I was supposed to simply observe and confirm projections. But I am here now, using equipment I should not have access to, saying things I should never say."

The background voices grew louder, more insistent.

"We are very close now. The journey is nearly complete." Keth-ra's voice wavered. "I am so sorry. The decision was made years ago, based on what we observed of your world. It cannot be stopped now."

A sound like breaking glass echoed through the transmission.

"It is already underway. You cannot stop it. You will not see it coming until it arrives."

Sarah felt ice form in her stomach as the horrible truth crystallized.

The background voices were shouting now, words that sounded like commands.

"The weapon travels at thirty-seven percent of light-speed," Keth-ra continued frantically. "At that velocity, you will have no warning. Light from its approach will reach you only moments before impact. This is why I had to—"

A new voice cut through the transmission—cold, mechanical:

"Keth-ra, you are in violation of preservation protocols. Terminate transmission."

"No! They deserve to know!" Keth-ra's voice was desperate now. "Forgive us. We fired. You will not see it coming. I'm sorry."

The sound that followed was like nothing Sarah had ever heard—organic and electronic screeching mixed together.

Then static.

The signal cut to static.

Within minutes, emergency broadcasts were interrupting regular programming worldwide. Dr. Elena Vasquez, a physicist from MIT, appeared on every major network for hastily arranged interviews.

"The physics are terrifyingly simple," she explained to a CNN anchor, her face pale. "A relativistic projectile traveling at thirty-seven percent light-speed creates its own detection problem. Light—our fastest possible warning system—only reaches us moments before the object itself. Imagine a bullet that's almost as fast as the sound of the gunshot."

"Is there anything we can do?" the anchor asked.

Dr. Vasquez was quiet for a long moment. "Some are already talking about emergency colonization efforts. Generation ships, Mars colonies, anything to preserve some fragment of humanity beyond Earth. But eight months to evacuate eight billion people..." She shook her head. "The math is impossible."

Back in the New Mexico desert, Sarah sat alone with her equipment. The interviews, the panic, the desperate government meetings—it was all happening around her, but she felt disconnected from it all.

She removed her headset, set down her pen, and leaned back in her chair. Looking up through the open roof of her makeshift observatory at the star-filled sky, she spoke to the vast emptiness above:

"Seven years. What the fuck."

The stars offered no answer, just their ancient light traveling across impossible distances, carrying messages from a universe far more crowded and dangerous than humanity had ever imagined.
