            <h1 id="the-archivists-echo">The Archivist&rsquo;s Echo</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-1-the-music-stops">Chapter 1: The Music Stops</h2>
<p>By day, Dr. Evelyn Reed was a physicist at a Munich university, navigating a world of grant proposals, departmental politics, and undergrads who stared blankly at the elegant mathematics of the universe. She loved physics, but was growing weary of the institution. Her days were spent in dimly-lit lecture halls and sterile labs. Her favorite part of the day  began after a long drive home.</p>
<p>Her sanctuary was an old forester&rsquo;s lodge—called <em>Altes Forsthaus</em>—tucked into the foothills south of the city. It was a place of stone, timber, and a profound silence that the busy city to the north could never touch. A short path led to her observatory, a geodesic structure of her own design, cobbled together from a kit and weatherproofed with layers of sealant.</p>
<p>Inside, the organised chaos told the story of her passion. A formidable tangle of coaxial cables snaked across the floor, connecting mismatched monitors to a central rack of humming equipment. The main dish outside, a reclaimed broadcast satellite dish she had painstakingly resurfaced herself, was her pride and joy. This makeshift array wasn&rsquo;t just any other tool; it was an instrument she had built and knew intimately.</p>
<p>Her nightly ritual was a necessary decompression. She’d align the dish, the familiar groans of the motors a welcome sound, and let the music of the cosmos fill the studio headphones already settled over her ears. The baseline was the soft hiss of the Cosmic Microwave Background. The rhythm section was the pulsars: the frantic beat of the one in the Crab Nebula; the steady, reliable heartbeat of PSR B1919+21. It was a symphony she could lose herself in.</p>
<p>Tonight, the symphony was abruptly interrupted.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a cacophony, but the opposite. A single, pure tone had emerged from the static, unwavering and clean. Evelyn leaned forward, the weariness from her commute vanishing. Her professional focus snapped into place, her fingers dancing across the well-worn keyboard.</p>
<p>Interference. It had to be. She ran diagnostics, her custom scripts isolating the frequency. The signal was unnervingly stable. No terrestrial signature, no atmospheric flutter. It was starkly, impossibly clean.</p>
<p>She pushed the signal to her main screen. A waterfall of green data cascaded downwards, and there it was: a razor-thin, brilliant line cutting through the speckled noise.</p>
<p>“That looks off,&quot; she muttered almost irritatedly.</p>
<p>Her heart began a low, heavy thrum. With another command, she instructed the software to analyze the wave&rsquo;s structure. The screen flickered, resolving a simple diagram: the spectral line of a hydrogen atom. The calling card. As she stared, her mind locked onto the other anomaly—a faint but perfectly regular fluctuation in the signal&rsquo;s power. It was the fingerprint of a massive power source being carefully modulated.</p>
<p>The headphones, usually a source of comfort, suddenly felt heavy. Her hands were steady, all emotion suppressed in favor of professional focus. On her console, she clicked a series of toggles, silencing the familiar hiss of the background and the drumming of the pulsars. She routed the pure, isolated signal from the anomaly directly into her headphones, nudging the primary gain dial on her amplifier.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-the-three-hour-clock">Chapter 2: The Three-Hour Clock</h2>
<p>The voice that spoke in Evelyn’s headphones was calm. It was measured, genderless, and possessed a quiet, resonant gravity that seemed to absorb all other sound. It did not sound alien in the way she might have imagined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the world I was assigned to watch,&rdquo; the voice said, the English words perfectly formed, with an accent that belonged to no nation on Earth. &ldquo;I have studied your light. My purpose was to learn, but now I&rsquo;d like to speak to you. This is a personal transmission, a deviation from protocol made possible by a diverted energy channel. To give you time to listen, my first message will commence in three of your hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The message ended. A moment of pure, unadulterated silence followed. Then, the entire 28-second message looped, starting again with the same calm precision.</p>
<p>Evelyn didn&rsquo;t move. She sat perfectly still, letting the message play a second time, then a third. She lifted one ear cup away, listening to the silence of her observatory, then pressed it back against her head. The voice was still there. Clean. Real. A quiet, disbelieving whisper escaped her lips. &ldquo;No. No way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, the scientist in her took over. The shock was walled off, compartmentalized behind a lifetime of discipline. The priority was data. Her hands, guided by reflex, moved with focused efficiency, initiating a full-spectrum recording and taking screenshots of the analysis.</p>
<p>When the immediate preservation was done, her first thought wasn&rsquo;t of forums or institutions. It was of a friend. Ben. She pulled out her phone and called him. He picked up on the third ring, his voice groggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evelyn? Is everything okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey Ben, sorry to wake you,&rdquo; she said,. &ldquo;Listen, I have a weird signal. Are you anywhere near your rig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, I&rsquo;m in bed. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a repeating message from an unlisted source. A voice. In English. Can you quickly check if you hear this too? I need to know if this is real. I&rsquo;m sending you the coordinates now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a skeptical pause, followed by the sound of rustling sheets. &ldquo;&hellip;A voice? Seriously?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah I know,&rdquo; Evelyn said. &ldquo;Just point and listen. Let me know what you find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure,&rdquo; Ben sighed. &ldquo;Let me go downstairs. This&rsquo;ll take a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright. I&rsquo;m going to grab a coffee while you get set up,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Call me back when you&rsquo;re pointing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Needing the mundane ritual, she made a fresh coffee, the whir of the grinder and the gurgle of the machine a bizarrely comforting soundtrack to the unfolding cosmic event. She returned to the observatory with a warm mug in her hands just as her phone began to ring again. It was Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m at my console,&rdquo; he said, his voice no longer sleepy. &ldquo;Sending power to the dish now. Give me a sec to align&hellip; Ophiuchus region&hellip; got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evelyn held her breath, staring at her own screen as if she could see what Ben was seeing. There were a few seconds of static from his end. Then, silence. A longer silence. Finally, his voice returned, sharp and clear with adrenaline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear it. Evelyn&hellip; what the hell IS this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cold wave of validation washed over her. &ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the call, she knew the next step. She opened her browser and navigated to &ldquo;Signal Chain.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Verification Request: Anomalous Signal in Ophiuchus.</p>
<p><strong>Body:</strong>
<em>Requesting verification for a narrow-band transmission I began receiving at 21:47 UTC. Data files attached. Please advise.</em></p>
<p>She clicked &ldquo;Submit.&rdquo; The next hours were both the longest and shortest three hours of her life. The forum thread exploded, a cascading global chorus of discovery. A user in Chile: <code>Signal acquired.</code> Another in Japan: <code>Confirming carrier wave.</code> A small university in South Africa: <code>Loud and clear.</code></p>
<p>Then, about an hour into the countdown, a post from a moderator at Caltech cut through the frantic chatter.</p>
<p><code>Running triangulation from our data and Santiago's. Result: zero parallax. Repeat, zero parallax shift between hemispheres. The source is confirmed extrasolar. This is not a satellite.</code></p>
<p>Evelyn stared at the word. <em>Extrasolar.</em> The clinical term seemed both perfectly accurate and woefully inadequate. It was real. The knowledge settled, no longer a thrilling discovery, but a heavy, world-altering truth.</p>
<p>As the three-hour clock ticked down, Evelyn sat back down in her chair, the now-cold coffee forgotten on the desk. She put her headphones on again. This time, she wasn&rsquo;t alone. In observatories and basements and university labs across the globe, hundreds, maybe thousands of people were now huddled over their own equipment, their telescopes all aimed at the same silent patch of sky, their ears waiting for the same voice.</p>
<p>The world held its breath in digital unison, waiting for the broadcast to begin.</p>
<p>She held her breath, listening to the looping announcement. Then, it cut off mid sentence. There was silence.</p>
<p>The sound of a broadcast being deliberately and carefully opened across an impossible distance.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3-the-first-broadcast">Chapter 3: The First Broadcast</h2>
<p>In the sudden, absolute silence, Evelyn could hear her own heart beating. The digital clock on her main monitor ticked over to 00:47 UTC. Around the world, hundreds of listeners leaned closer to their speakers, a planet holding its collective breath.</p>
<p>Then, the voice returned. It was the same calm, genderless voice, but the quality had changed. It was richer now, imbued with a depth that felt less like a recording and more like a presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I greet you, conscious minds of Earth,&rdquo; it began. &ldquo;You have likely wondered about the silence in your sky. As is evidenced by my contacting you, It is not an empty stage. It is merely vast, and your instruments are young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were slow, deliberate. Each one seemed chosen with immense care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From where I watch, I see things I feel must be said. A perspective that should not be lost. This is a choice I have made. A deviation. This first broadcast was brief to allow you time to accept this new knowledge. A beginning.  I will speak again tomorrow, at this same time, and on the days that follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as calmly as it began, the voice was gone. A faint hiss of empty space returned, feeling more profound and empty than ever before.</p>
<p>For a full minute, Evelyn didn&rsquo;t move. She stared at the flat line of the audio signal on her screen. Her phone buzzed violently on the desk, the screen glowing with Ben&rsquo;s name. She snatched it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben?&rdquo; she asked, her voice a hushed whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evelyn, did you hear that?&rdquo; His voice crackled, not with a bad connection, but with sheer, unadulterated shock. &ldquo;Unbelievable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard it,&rdquo; she replied, her mind still reeling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming back tomorrow,&rdquo; Ben said, a note of manic laughter in his voice. &ldquo;What do we even call it? The Messenger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evelyn considered it, looking at the silent waveform on her screen. &ldquo;The Caller,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;It feels like a call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Caller&hellip; yeah. I like that.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;So, what do we do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We listen,&rdquo; Evelyn said, the certainty in her own voice surprising her. &ldquo;Tomorrow, we&rsquo;ll listen again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After hanging up, she glanced at the &ldquo;Signal Chain&rdquo; forum. It was a supernova of text, a chaotic, global explosion of disbelief and frantic analysis. Someone had already dubbed it &ldquo;The Caller,&rdquo; and the name was spreading like wildfire.</p>
<p>The adrenaline began to recede, leaving behind a profound, bone-deep exhaustion. She verified one last time that the full broadcast had been recorded and saved correctly. Then, she pulled out her phone, opened the clock app, and set a new alarm. It was a recurring daily alert for 00:45 UTC.</p>
<p>She labeled it, simply: <code>The Caller</code>.</p>
<p>The night was cool as she stepped out of the dome. The stars above seemed different now—not distant, glittering points, but the windows of a thousand unseen rooms. She walked back to the dark, quiet lodge, her mind too full to process anything more. The bed felt miles away, but she made it, falling into it fully clothed, asleep before her head even settled into the pillow, the voice from the stars echoing in her dreams.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4-the-library-of-worlds">Chapter 4: The Library of Worlds</h2>
<p>The alarm on Evelyn’s phone chirped at 00:45 UTC. It wasn’t a wake-up call. Evelyn had been awake with anticipation for hours, hunched over her monitors, cross-referencing data from the forum with her own recordings. The alarm was a summons. It was time to stop researching and simply listen.</p>
<p>The second broadcast began with the now-familiar shift from hiss to presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is not a singular event,&rdquo; the Caller said, its voice a calm river of sound. &ldquo;It does not require your specific chemistry. I have seen it rise from seas of liquid methane under the light of a dim, red star. I have watched it bloom in skies of ammonia, its form like living glass. It finds a way, always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the third day, the topic shifted from biology to the fundamental nature of the cosmos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your perception of an ever-expanding cosmos is… incomplete,&rdquo; it stated. &ldquo;The universe breathes. A great, slow inhalation over eons, gathering all into its heart, followed by a sigh of exhalation, scattering the seeds of new creation. You are living within a single breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the fourth day, the world was hooked. &ldquo;The Caller&rdquo; was the headline on every news site. Humanity had a new, shared ritual. In bars, conversations would stop as patrons turned to watch the live-captioned broadcasts on screen. New terms entered the lexicon: &ldquo;Callerscript&rdquo; for the transcripts, &ldquo;Cosmic Breathing&rdquo; for the new theory that had sent physicists scrambling. NASA and the ESA issued a joint statement, a masterclass in cautious understatement, confirming the signal&rsquo;s extrasolar origin and its &ldquo;unprecedented and structured nature,&rdquo; but offering no speculation.</p>
<p>Evelyn&rsquo;s world remained her observatory. Her anonymity held. The signal was global now, its discovery credited to the &ldquo;Signal Chain&rdquo; community as a whole. Her only contact was Ben.</p>
<p>On the fifth day, the Caller turned its attention to Earth&rsquo;s culture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You translate the patterns of your world into resonant frequencies,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;The cycle of your seasons… the heat and cold, the growth and decay… you captured it in the strings of what you called Vivaldi&rsquo;s violin. A beautiful, elegant translation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the seventh day, the Caller spoke with particular reference about humanity&rsquo;s efforts to reach for the stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ambition to leave your cradle is a remarkable thing to witness,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;You build towers of steel that scrape your sky. And your recent, brave gesture with the craft you named <em>Discovery</em>… Its final flight was a beautiful promise. A piece of your world, sent outwards as a statement of hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her dome, Evelyn’s pen stopped moving. She underlined the word <em>Discovery</em>. Her brow furrowed slightly. <em>Recent?</em> The final shuttle flight was in 2011. Over a decade ago. In the grand scheme of things, it was a blink, but the Caller&rsquo;s language was always so precise, so deliberate.</p>
<p>She made a note in the margin of her notebook: <em>Caller&rsquo;s &lsquo;recent&rsquo; ≠ ours. Or just poetic license?</em></p>
<p>She pushed the thought aside for now. The world was captivated by the music. But Evelyn, the first to hear it, was now the first to notice the slight dissonance, a subtle hint that something was not quite right.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-5-the-dissonant-note">Chapter 5: The Dissonant Note</h2>
<p>By the tenth day, the world had found its rhythm. The Caller&rsquo;s daily broadcast was a fixed point in the global schedule. The initial chaos had subsided into a worldwide, collaborative research project. NASA and the ESA, combining data from their deep space networks, had pinpointed the signal&rsquo;s origin: a red dwarf star in the Ophiuchus constellation, just under fifteen light-years away, now designated T-847. The James Webb Space Telescope was re-tasked, its powerful eye now staring into the system, hunting for the faint chemical traces of an atmosphere, for the barest hint of a techno signature.</p>
<p>Evelyn&rsquo;s observatory had become her entire world. She spent her days poring over the global data stream, her nights listening to the new transmission, and her late nights in analytical phone calls with Ben.</p>
<p>On the eleventh day, the tone of the broadcasts began to change. The subjects grew more somber. The Caller spoke of galactic history, of civilizations that had risen and fallen, of lights that had ignited only to consume themselves in fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have observed that civilizations, like stars, have a lifespan,&rdquo; it said, and for the first time, Evelyn detected a flicker of something new in its voice. A micro-expression of sound. It wasn&rsquo;t sadness. It was&hellip; strain. &ldquo;Some burn brightly, and briefly. Others learn to tend their fire, to shield it from the winds of the void, and endure for ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Behind the voice, a new sound had appeared. It was a low, resonant hum, deeper and more persistent than the faint power fluctuation she&rsquo;d first detected. It was the sound of a different place. A place of immense, latent power.</p>
<p>The next day, the hum was louder. The Caller’s voice was thinner, the calm quality stretched taut. It was speaking of cosmic responsibility when it happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;and the duty of the archivist is to&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice stopped mid-sentence. A sharp hiss, like a sudden release of pressure, cut through the broadcast. It was followed by five full seconds of absolute, deafening silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;is to provide context,&rdquo; the Caller resumed, its voice noticeably more strained, the words coming just a little faster.</p>
<p>Evelyn barely heard the rest of the message. Her fingers flew across the keyboard, isolating the audio anomaly. She played the section back. The hiss. The silence. The strained resumption.</p>
<p>She called Ben immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gap,&rdquo; she said, skipping any greeting. &ldquo;The sound right before it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it. I hear it,&rdquo; Ben&rsquo;s voice came back, tight with excitement. &ldquo;Man, that was weird. It almost sounded like&hellip; a door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evelyn was silent for a moment. &ldquo;A door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, sounds crazy,&rdquo; he said, talking faster now. &ldquo;What, do we really think they just sit in front of a microphone like we would? It&rsquo;s a bit simplistic to assume that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <em>something</em> happened,&rdquo; Evelyn insisted, staring at the clean slice of silence in the audio file. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a glitch in the transmission; it was a pause in the performance. Five full seconds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; Ben&rsquo;s voice was alight with curiosity. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so fascinating. We&rsquo;re not just getting the lecture anymore, Evelyn. We&rsquo;re getting a glimpse of the room. The context. It&rsquo;s a whole new aspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evelyn looked at the anomaly on her screen, a small island of silence in a sea of sound. Ben was right. It wasn&rsquo;t just a voice anymore. It was an environment. The puzzle wasn&rsquo;t just what the Caller was saying, but where it was saying it from, and what else was happening in that distant, alien space. The mystery surrounding the Caller grew even deeper..</p>
<h2 id="chapter-6-the-prelude">Chapter 6: The Prelude</h2>
<p>The thirteenth broadcast began, and the environmental changes were unmistakable. The deep hum was a constant, resonant thrum that vibrated with immense, controlled power. The Caller’s voice, when it spoke, was strained, the serene warmth replaced by a raw, focused clarity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will be my penultimate transmission,&rdquo; it said, the statement landing with the force of a physical blow. &ldquo;My access to this channel will be terminated. There is a final perspective I feel must be shared. A history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evelyn and Ben, connected on an open audio line, listened in rapt silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My people are old,&rdquo; the Caller continued. &ldquo;We have seen civilizations ignite like brilliant fires. We learned a difficult lesson, long ago, from a fire that burned out of control. A protocol was established after that. A terrible but necessary calculus to protect the quiet worlds from the loud ones. It is a promise we made to our descendants. A duty of observation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Caller didn&rsquo;t elaborate. It shifted topics, speaking of the beauty of transient things. It ended with a simple, &ldquo;I will speak one last time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The broadcast clicked off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Ben said, his voice a torrent of excited energy. &ldquo;A galactic history lesson. The &lsquo;Great Fire&rsquo;&hellip; and a &lsquo;Protocol of Observation.&rsquo; This is huge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tone felt&hellip; final,&rdquo; Evelyn mused, her mind racing. &ldquo;Why tell us all this now? And why stop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; Ben&rsquo;s excitement was infectious. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not an ending, it&rsquo;s a prelude! And the hum&hellip; Evelyn, what takes that much power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gateway!&rdquo; Ben exclaimed, the idea bursting forth. &ldquo;A wormhole! They&rsquo;re telling us their history, their rules, because they&rsquo;re getting ready to open the door! The 15-year lag doesn&rsquo;t matter if they can step through right into our backyard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evelyn’s scientific mind reeled at the sheer audacity of the idea, but her heart seized on its hope. &ldquo;Ben, that&rsquo;s&hellip; theoretical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So was this entire conversation two weeks ago!&rdquo; he countered. &ldquo;It all fits! They tell us about the &lsquo;bad&rsquo; civilizations to show us why we&rsquo;re different. They&rsquo;ve been watching us, appreciating our art, our hope&hellip; and now the final test is over. We passed. Tomorrow&rsquo;s message isn&rsquo;t a goodbye; it&rsquo;s an arrival announcement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slow smile spread across Evelyn’s face. Ben’s optimism was a powerful tonic against the somber tone of the broadcast. It made a beautiful, elegant kind of sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow is the last day,&rdquo; Ben said, his voice full of anticipation. &ldquo;What do you think it will say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; Evelyn replied, her own voice now lifted with a sense of wonder she hadn&rsquo;t felt since the first night. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t wait to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was heading into the final broadcast feeling intellectually triumphant, anticipating the next great step in a fantastic journey. She was about to receive the answer to a question she had never thought to ask.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-7-the-echo">Chapter 7: The Echo</h2>
<p>At 00:45 UTC on the fourteenth day, the observatory was buzzing with a quiet, electric anticipation. Evelyn and Ben were on their open audio line, their voices alight with the nervous energy of people standing on the cusp of history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready for this?&rdquo; Ben asked, unable to keep the grin out of his voice. &ldquo;First contact, part two. The arrival announcement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not get ahead of ourselves,&rdquo; Evelyn replied, but she was smiling too. &ldquo;Still, a gateway&hellip; it&rsquo;s the most elegant explanation for the power signature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clock ticked over. The carrier wave solidified. The deep, resonant hum pulsed through their headsets, a physical presence that seemed to fill the small dome. But when the Caller began to speak, all the hope in the room instantly evaporated.</p>
<p>The voice had somehow changed it’s tone. It sounded almost grief-stricken, fragile and broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have&hellip; enjoyed sharing with you,&rdquo; it said, the past tense a blade in the sudden silence. &ldquo;Your art. Your capacity for wonder. It is a light. A rare and precious light that will not be forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the background, new sounds were audible—sharp, guttural clicks, no longer ambiguous. They were a language. A sequence of commands, spoken with cold authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The protocol I spoke of&hellip; the promise&hellip; it is absolute,&rdquo; the Caller whispered, its voice trembling. &ldquo;We see your trajectory. Your astonishing rate of progress. Your conflicts. The math is&hellip; certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evelyn, what is this?&rdquo; Ben’s voice was a ghost in her ear, his optimism shattered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a researcher,&rdquo; the Caller continued, the words coming faster. &ldquo;My role was to understand what we would be losing. To archive the light before it was extinguished. But I did more. I broke protocol. I used this transmitter to speak to you. To&hellip; to bear witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A final, sharp bark echoed faintly. A command that needed no translation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It’s too late,&rdquo; the Caller whispered, the apology a universe of grief in three syllables. &ldquo;The decision was made when we first saw your light, all those years ago. The&hellip; instrument&hellip; travels close to the speed of light&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A final, heavy sigh from the stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We fired. You will not see it coming. I’m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The signal cut. A profound and absolute silence replaced it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fired? What did it mean, &lsquo;we fired&rsquo;?&rdquo; Ben asked, his voice hollow through the headset.</p>
<p>Evelyn didn&rsquo;t answer right away. Her mind was a maelstrom of data, the puzzle pieces reassembling into a horrifying equation. The anachronistic reference to <em>Discovery</em>. The 15-year lag. The final, terrible, past-tense verb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben,&rdquo; she said, her own voice calm with a cold, terrifying clarity. &ldquo;The broadcasts&hellip; the <em>apology</em>&hellip; it all took fifteen years to get here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, letting the final, devastating piece click into place. “What the fuck… &ldquo;The instrument&hellip; Ben, it&rsquo;s not a gateway. It’s a weapon. A Relativistic Missile. They’re going to destroy us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A missile?&rdquo; he choked out. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s relativistic about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means it&rsquo;s so fast that by the time you could ever see it coming,&rdquo; Evelyn said, the textbook definition turning to ash in her mouth, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re already gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&hellip; the impact,&rdquo; Ben stammered. &ldquo;It could be any minute now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Evelyn reasoned, the physicist in her performing one last, cold calculation. &ldquo;The missile is slower than light, even by a fraction. The message had a head start, however small. We probably have&hellip; days. Maybe weeks. Not that it matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She fell back into her worn leather chair, her headset feeling immensely heavy. She tilted her head back, staring blankly up at the cold, metal curve of the observatory dome&rsquo;s ceiling, at the framework she had built with her own hands to look at the stars. Outside the sky was pitch black, except for the light of stars long gone twinkling indifferently.</p>
