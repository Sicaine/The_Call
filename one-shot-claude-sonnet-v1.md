# The Call

## Day 1

Sarah Martinez had been listening to the cosmos for three years from her makeshift observatory in the New Mexico desert. The old radio telescope dish, salvaged from a defunct research facility, hummed quietly in the pre-dawn darkness as she swept through frequencies that most people would dismiss as cosmic background noise.

At 3:47 AM, something changed.

The static shifted—not random, but structured. Pattern within chaos. Sarah's coffee grew cold as she fine-tuned the receiver, her heart racing with the possibility that had driven every radio astronomer since the field began: *What if?*

The signal strengthened. Clearer. And then, impossibly, words emerged from the static.

"Planet Earth, please listen. If you can hear me, please listen. I will continue my transmission in approximately three hours."

The message repeated. Again. Again.

Sarah's hands shook as she hit record.

## Day 2

The forums exploded overnight. Sarah's recording, uploaded to amateur radio astronomy boards, spread like wildfire. Within hours, dozens of operators worldwide were tuning to the frequency. The signal was real, consistent, and impossible to fake across multiple continents.

When the voice returned, it was different. More conversational.

"I hope you received my previous message. My name is... the closest translation would be Keth-ra. I am transmitting from a research vessel approximately 4.2 light-years from your solar system."

The voice paused, as if waiting for a response that could never come.

"I have been studying your world for some time. Your species fascinates me. You create such beautiful music—I particularly enjoy what you call 'jazz.' Miles Davis, John Coltrane... extraordinary expressions of mathematical harmony made emotional."

Around the world, amateur radio operators frantically took notes, their excitement building with each impossible detail.

## Day 5

"Today I want to tell you about the universe as we see it," Keth-ra's voice crackled through the static. "You are not alone. There are forty-seven intelligent species within a hundred light-years of Earth. Most are peaceful. Some... are not."

Sarah had barely slept since the transmissions began. Her small observatory had become an impromptu command center, with other enthusiasts driving from across the Southwest to witness history.

"Your solar system sits in what we call a 'development zone'—a region where younger civilizations are allowed to grow without interference. Think of it as a nature preserve for emerging consciousness."

The implications sent chills through every listener.

"But there are protocols. Rules. When a species reaches certain technological thresholds, decisions must be made."

## Day 8

The transmissions had become daily events, drawing audiences in the millions as major news networks picked up the story. Governments remained officially skeptical, but Sarah noticed unusual activity around radio telescopes worldwide.

"I want to share something personal," Keth-ra said. "I have a offspring-bond—you would say 'child'—who asks me constantly about your world. They are fascinated by your concept of 'childhood'—the extended period of learning and play before responsibility. Our species transitions to adulthood much more abruptly."

The alien's voice carried what sounded almost like wistfulness.

"My offspring-bond particularly loves your animated stories. 'Finding Nemo' brought them great joy—the idea of such dedication between parent and child across vast distances resonates deeply with our own biology."

Sarah frowned. *Finding Nemo*? That was from 2003. Why would an advanced alien civilization studying Earth be referencing such old cultural artifacts?

## Day 11

"I must tell you about the Void Swarm," Keth-ra continued during what had become the most-watched daily event in human history. "Forty thousand years ago, they consumed the Altair system. Twelve billion conscious beings, gone in a stellar year. The survivors' last transmission was a warning: 'They learn from what they consume. Every world makes them smarter, hungrier.'"

The tone had grown darker over recent days.

"This is why the Interstellar Preservation Council exists. We monitor emerging civilizations for signs of expansion beyond their home systems. When species begin to spread, they can become vectors for the Swarm's attention."

Sarah's blood ran cold. She'd been tracking the references, the cultural touchstones Keth-ra mentioned. All of them—every movie, every song, every piece of human culture—dated from before 2010.

## Day 13

"Your species is remarkable," Keth-ra transmitted. "You have created concepts we struggle to understand—'hope' in the face of certain death, 'love' that transcends genetic advantage, 'art' that serves no survival function yet drives your greatest achievements."

Sarah stared at her notes, the pattern now undeniable. She'd been calculating light-speed delays, comparing cultural references. The evidence was building toward a conclusion that made her stomach twist.

"I have studied your history extensively. The way you rebuilt after your 'World War II,' the progress you made in medicine and space exploration, the gradual recognition of universal rights... it gives me what you would call 'hope.'"

But Sarah wasn't feeling hopeful anymore. She was feeling terrified.

## Day 14

"I need to tell you something important," Keth-ra's voice carried a weight that hadn't been there before. "Our studies of your world began fifteen years ago, when we first detected your radio signatures spreading beyond your solar system."

Sarah's hands clenched. Fifteen years ago. 2010. Every reference finally made sense.

"We analyzed your trajectory—technological development, resource consumption, population growth, weapons advancement. We ran projections forward, modeling your likely expansion into space."

The static seemed heavier now, filled with something that might have been regret.

"According to our models, your species will achieve interstellar travel within fifty years. And when you do..." The voice paused. "Forgive me. I should explain why this matters."

Sarah's radio crackled with interference—voices in the background, speaking in a language that sounded like crystalline chimes mixed with grinding metal.

"The Council has protocols. Species that expand aggressively, that show certain psychological profiles for conquest and resource extraction, that demonstrate what we call 'viral expansion patterns'... they become eligible for preemptive intervention."

More voices in the background now, urgent and angry.

"I was not supposed to make contact. I was supposed to simply observe, to confirm our projections before the Council acted. But I couldn't... I couldn't let it happen without saying something. Without letting you know that we saw your beauty, your potential, your extraordinary complexity."

The background voices grew louder, more insistent.

"They are coming for me now. I have violated the most fundamental law of the Preservation Council. But I needed you to know—we debated for three years. Some of us argued that your species was worth the risk, that your capacity for growth and change might lead to a different outcome."

A sound like breaking glass echoed through the transmission.

"We were overruled. The decision was made based on data from your year 2010. Your wars, your environmental destruction, your accelerating weapons development... the projections were clear."

Sarah realized she was crying, tears streaming down her face as the truth crystallized.

"The projectile was launched eight years ago. It travels at thirty percent light-speed. It will arrive in approximately seven years. You will not see it coming—it's designed to avoid detection until the final moment."

The background voices were shouting now, words that sounded like commands, like warnings.

"I am sorry. I am so deeply sorry. Perhaps... perhaps you will prove our projections wrong in the time that remains. Perhaps you will find a way to change, to become something beautiful instead of something that spreads like a virus across the stars."

A new voice cut through the transmission—cold, mechanical, speaking in perfect English:

"Researcher Keth-ra, you are in violation of Preservation Protocol Seven. Terminate transmission immediately."

"No," Keth-ra's voice was firm. "They deserve to know. They deserve the chance to—"

The sound that followed was like nothing Sarah had ever heard—a wet, organic cracking mixed with electronic screeching.

Then silence.

Then a different voice, clinical and emotionless:

"Citizens of Earth. Researcher Keth-ra has been detained for violation of interstellar law. This transmission is terminated. You have seven years."

The signal cut to static.

Sarah sat in the desert silence, staring at her equipment, her mind racing with the horrible mathematics of it all. Seven years from now. A relativistic missile launched eight years ago, when the world was a different place, when humanity was still climbing out of a recession, still fighting old wars, still burning fossil fuels like there was no tomorrow.

And now, thanks to their judgment of who humanity was in 2010, there might not be one.

She looked up at the stars, those distant points of light that had seemed so beautiful and mysterious just two weeks ago. Now they felt like the eyes of judges, watching and waiting to see if humanity could become something worth saving in the time they had left.

The radio hissed softly in the background, carrying nothing but the cosmic static of an indifferent universe.

Seven years.

Sarah reached for her phone to call the authorities, to warn the world, to begin the desperate race against time. But deep down, she wondered if it would make any difference at all.

The universe had already decided who humanity was, based on who they had been.

Whether they could become something else in seven years remained to be seen.
