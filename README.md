# The Call - a short story experiment

A spontanious idea for a scifi short story from me which i'd like to experiment with together with AI/LLM.

## Tl;dr vs a short synopsis not yet refined

A person on earth listens to space through a radio telescope. That person catches a transmission, which looks weird/ununusual. After tuning into it with a little bit of fideling, suddenly a voice appears. It starts talking "Planet earth please listen, if you can hear me, please listen. I will continue my transmission in approximitly 3 hours". Its a reaping message and it creats a frantic communication in hobby circles. It spreads across the planet. 

The person in question, records everything and starts to listen in. 

<At this point it becomes clear over the next 2 weeks (the whole story plays in this timeframe) that this is a real transmission from outer space and its not a human being but an alien. This alien starts to talk about different things <here we need to create cool things> how that alien sees earth, how the universe is not empty, etc. etc.>>

When the story starts to reach the end, something weird starts to happen which is not very clear. The alien telling stories etc. it might start to come across that this alien knows a lot of details of earth and uses high tech which is not that common for everyone on their planet to just be used. That alien, in the last very very last stretch of the story appologies says its too late and you can hear some weird noise which might sound like language but its not the alien. The alien says as a last sentence "We fired. You will not see it coming. Im sorry."

Additional notes: The story should convey somehow that the alien knows a lot about earth but not from 2025 but more like 15 years ago. That should not be too obvouus and it might be cooler for the earth people to discover/calculate this after the last sentence from the alien after realizing what just happened.

So what happend? The alien race discovered the planet earth with some <very advanced tec> what we are, how we are etc. They decided to build and shot a Relativistic Missile while the alien voice is one researcher in their military complex for interstellar preventive warfare (there is probably also a normal warfare center but is probably not relevant) and decided to use his/her acccess to start talking to earth. They studied earth (as by protocol) to still apprecheate the culture and the creation of earth but they see the triactory of earth and as threat due to some experience they made.
