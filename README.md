# The Call - a short story experiment

A spontanious idea for a scifi short story from me which i'd like to experiment with together with AI/LLM.

## The stories generated

I generated mulitply versions of this story with different models. This list is currated but it might be fun to read more versions of it.

- [Gemini Pro 2.5 v2](one-shot-gemini-pro-2.5-preview-v2.md)
- [Claude Sonnet 3.7 v2](one-shot-claude-sonnet-v2.md)

## Tl;dr vs a short synopsis not refined

A person on earth listens to space through a radio telescope. That person catches a transmission, which looks weird/ununusual. After tuning into it with a little bit of fideling, suddenly a voice appears. It starts talking "Planet earth please listen, if you can hear me, please listen. I will continue my transmission in approximitly 3 hours". Its a reaping message and it creats a frantic communication in hobby circles. It spreads across the planet. 

The person in question, records everything and starts to listen in. 

<At this point it becomes clear over the next 2 weeks (the whole story plays in this timeframe) that this is a real transmission from outer space and its not a human being but an alien. This alien starts to talk about different things <here we need to create cool things> how that alien sees earth, how the universe is not empty, etc. etc.>>

When the story starts to reach the end, something weird starts to happen which is not very clear. The alien telling stories etc. it might start to come across that this alien knows a lot of details of earth and uses high tech which is not that common for everyone on their planet to just be used. That alien, in the last very very last stretch of the story appologies says its too late and you can hear some weird noise which might sound like language but its not the alien. The alien says as a last sentence "We fired. You will not see it coming. Im sorry."

Additional notes: The story should convey somehow that the alien knows a lot about earth but not from 2025 but more like 15 years ago. That should not be too obvouus and it might be cooler for the earth people to discover/calculate this after the last sentence from the alien after realizing what just happened.

So what happend? The alien race discovered the planet earth with some <very advanced tec> what we are, how we are etc. They decided to build and shot a Relativistic Missile while the alien voice is one researcher in their military complex for interstellar preventive warfare (there is probably also a normal warfare center but is probably not relevant) and decided to use his/her acccess to start talking to earth. They studied earth (as by protocol) to still apprecheate the culture and the creation of earth but they see the triactory of earth and as threat due to some experience they made.


## Characters

### The alien
The alien can have any type of gender. It should not matter at all. The alien might suggest its name through something like "closest translation would be" or would not say its name at all. 

The alien is part of a high ranked military system / facility with its main responsiblity is observation of the universe and preemptive strikes against potential threats.

So this alien knows very well what they do, what type of access they have and they do not talk about earth to anyone outside of that facility. Either because its secret (top secret doesn't make sense, this species is highly advanced and transparent enough but they also have some hierarchy and you are not getting to that position without being some type of expert) or because they break laws/protocols.

Their job is to become an expert of one species over a span of years. Learning the language, culture etc. Recording data to put into the archive but due to them becoming an expert of that species, when the missile gets shot, they are part of that. Basically they use most equipment of the facility besides the weapon stuff, but when their project/species reaches a certain level, they are part of that shot event. On one side to make sure that the military experts hit the right target (coordinates, vectors, planet etc.) but also to verify after that it was successful and to put every detail into the archive. Basically being part of such a project from beginning to end.

Whats the motivation for the alien to talk to earth? They haven't done that too often, perhaps its the first few species they investigate. Doesn't matter to much but could help. It also might be that something was particularly interesting. Like if you have hive mind alines more like swarms which do not create that much art/culture. Or the languages were easier to learn/comprehend.

The alien starts with the transmission in a way unclear why. Like it want to communicate with us but knows we are to far away and a missile will get fired. But its still 2 weeks away and it knows it doesn't want us worried. The stroke the last sentence will happen but it will not happen in the aliens normal transmission room/lab but at the missile shooting space. So the tension will be a lot higher at the end not in the middle.

The alien starts slow telling who it is perhaps (name, small chit chat), perhaps it will start explain a little bit about universe and other races. It might start to explain a type of protocol or bad experience very close to the end. Like imagine a day before or a few hours before it sits at its normal workstation/lab and knows they all will meet up at the firering station/setup/control room and than shares a slight glimpse of why all of this.

### The listner
The listner is a person. Either male or female, not important but that persons perspective is the counter part to the alien. It could be someone in an official position to listen to stuff like this but its a hard sale because normally you have 'time on a radio telescopoe' and that would not fit very well. The signal should be clear enough for a real enthusiast to be caught and heared. Which implies that after that person becomes aware of that signal, the rest of the world will start listening into it too.

I don't want it to be a person from SETI. The Orgstructure wouldn't fit. A hobby person with perhaps a degree in astrophysics but makes their money in a different field / in the industry and thats just their hobby. 

But definitly a person who likes to listen to it. Either in background for relaxing or learning and being able to 'understand other stars' better through sound. Nothing crazy fancy but a little bit of personallity.

### Others

The main entities is the alien talking and the Listner, listening. The listener should be someone the reader can imagine and living the story through the listner.

But there might be a motivation for 1-2 other people. Either to sometimes hear about the rest of the worlds reaction aka "News Anchor XY reporting about the newest update to this" or "The Bundeskanzler of Germany explaining things to the public" etc. If there are others, it should be consistent. Either by always having one reporter, or always different reporters were its clear the reporters are just not relevant as a person but convey certin things. Like how other countries react.

### The reacton of the world


### Locations

The story plays on our planet earth. Today / year 2025. It should be mentioned very soon to make sure in the future the story sitll works but the focus is not the year but the 'current' vs. when the aliens started to listen to us / started survaying us.

The aliens shot their weapon from a planet, not a spaceship. They do not travel to us and they might not be able to travel that fast. It might be their main planet or it might be a planet further away from their main planet. Perhaps a close by solar system rebuild to have a weapon like this. Should not matter for the short story but they are not on a spaceship and they are not on a purely research station. They are clearly at a Military focused Military/Research station or solar system.

### Technologies
#### The transmission
So the alien knows very well what the capabilites of earth were in the past like 10-15 years ago. Which implies that it creates mechanism to give a human being the chance to be able to see the transmission and following it.

So thats why the alien starts to creates one basic message (can be longer/shorter, should be the same) which tells us to start listening. It should also gives us some type of signal or timeframe like 'continueing my transmission in x hours'.


While the signal is not unlimited strong, it is strong enough, might be repeated in a way, might have some error correction. Its not live live in sense of you can just hear it but it should be possible for the listner to do a little bit of cleanup, reconstruction and than hear a voice. if thats too far fetched, could be basic text encoded with basic ansii. I do prefer a voice.

The signal is probably faster than the missile, but i don't know. I assume the missile is very very slightly slower and therefore hits weeks to month after the alien said its last words. .. I'm not good enough of understanding this detail though. An immediate hit would be very unrealistic, weeks or month sound reasonable. There could be two endings, one were we know its just weeks/month and thats it or we can keep it open if earth survives with like 10-15 years.

#### Relativistic Missile
The Relativistic Missile is shot at earth somehow. Shouldn't matter but its clear it will hit earth. Or our solar system in a way that we as humans will die. I prefer the missile to hit earth. It should travel very close to light speed.

#### Regarding the distance of the aliesn to us
So the aliens can either be very close like 10-15 lightyears, which should make all of this reasonable doable but requires some mechanism or explanation why we are completly clueless that they are so close by.

Or they have some other technology to make this distance shorter but in a way that normal laws still apply. Like they created a wormhole or found one. Might not be too relevant but something should and could be explained simply.


### The starting message

Collection of good ideas overall:

Good overall:
    The Signal: A perfectly clean carrier wave, but embedded within it is a faint, repeating pattern—a visual representation of the hydrogen atom's spectral line, the classic "we are here" signal for astronomers.
    The Message (a calm, genderless voice, like a documentarian):
    "I am opening a narrow-band channel on a frequency I believe you will find. I have been your silent observer. My purpose was to learn, and I have learned much. Now, my purpose is to speak. My primary transmission will begin in three of your standard hours. I have much to share."


Interesting but the alien can have a name. The 'designation is irrelevant' could stay but its not important at all; I really like the 'the world i was assigned to watch':

    The Signal: A series of soft, resonant tones that slowly resolve into a single, sustained, mournful note before the message begins.
    The Message (a quiet, almost whispering voice):
    "To the world I was assigned to watch. I have studied your light for fifteen of your years. My designation is irrelevant. What is relevant is that a voice should be heard before the silence. I will begin speaking in three hours. Forgive this intrusion."


Makes it clear its one entity and its also a little bit on the side thing:
    The Signal: A strong, clean carrier wave with a subtle, rhythmic power fluctuation, detectable only by sensitive equipment—the ghost of a system being used for an unintended purpose.
    The Message (a focused, calm voice):
    "I have diverted a fraction of the array's power to establish this personal transmission. I have observed your world for your designated cycles; now, I choose to speak. My first message will follow in three of your standard hours."


I like the more technical way of the alien talking. Its interestingly different. Im not to happy with the data-stream. Its more adhoc what the alien is doing.
    The Signal: A strong, clean carrier wave with a subtle, rhythmic power fluctuation, detectable only by sensitive equipment—the ghost of a system being used for an unintended purpose.
    The Message (a precise, almost clinical voice):
    "I am addressing you outside of my designated protocol. A directed energy channel has been established for this purpose. To allow for signal acquisition on your world, this message will repeat. The primary data-stream will commence in three standard Earth hours."
